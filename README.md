# Save-Data-Backups

This repo serves as a source control and backup for all game save data that I have been able to dump from physical media, so that it may be playable in future

If the title is complete it will have a COMPLETE.txt file in the same directory as the game data. If it is blank, incomplete or unchecked it will have a BLANK.txt, INCOMPLETE.txt or UNCHECKED.txt respectively
